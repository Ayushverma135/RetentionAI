# RetentionAI

__RetentionAI__ involves leveraging data analytics and predictive modeling techniques to anticipate customer behaviors and optimize retention strategies. By analyzing historical patterns and identifying key indicators of customer loyalty or churn, businesses can proactively tailor their approaches to mitigate churn risks and foster long-term customer relationships. 

This proactive approach not only enhances customer satisfaction but also drives sustainable growth by maximizing customer retention and lifetime value, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and successful business ecosystem.

## Features
- __Predictive Models:__ Includes LSTM-based models for time-series analysis of customer retention data.
- __Data Preprocessing:__ Scripts for data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
- __Evaluation:__ Metrics for evaluating model performance and effectiveness in predicting customer churn.
- __Visualization:__ Tools for visualizing retention trends and model predictions.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of an __LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)__ neural network, which is well-suited for sequential data analysis such as time-series forecasting. LSTM layers are followed by dense layers for prediction.
